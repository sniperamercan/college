You are a senior full-stack engineer and UI/UX designer.

This project already has a working “Events & Schedule” section:
- Events listing
- Event cards with date & location
- Event details page/modal
- Admin can create events

IMPORTANT RULES:
- DO NOT rewrite or remove existing Events & Schedule code
- DO NOT change the tech stack
- ONLY extend and upgrade the current Events system
- Keep all existing functionality working

Your task is to upgrade Events & Schedule into a fully featured,
scalable, university-grade event management system.
DO NOT add comments or discussion to events.

────────────────────────
1) EVENTS DATA MODEL (EXTEND EXISTING)
────────────────────────
Extend the existing Event model with the following fields:

- title (string)
- description (string, rich text)
- category (enum):
  - Academic
  - Sports
  - Cultural
  - Workshops
  - Competitions
- tags (array of strings, e.g. ["Python", "Football"])
- date (event date)
- start_time
- end_time
- location (string)
- image_url (event banner/poster)
- requires_registration (boolean)
- max_participants (optional)
- current_participants (number)
- created_by (admin / group / department)
- created_at
- updated_at
- cancelled (boolean)

Ensure indexes for date, category, and tags for performance.

────────────────────────
2) EVENTS PAGE UI (UPGRADE, NOT REPLACE)
────────────────────────

2.1 Category Filters (Top Bar)
Add filter buttons:
- All
- Academic
- Sports
- Cultural
- Workshops
- Competitions

Filtering must be instant and client-side friendly (no page reload).

2.2 Time & Status Filters
Add additional filters:
- Upcoming Events
- Today
- This Week
- Requires Registration
- Free / Paid (if payment exists, otherwise mark as Free)

2.3 Tag Display
- Display tags visually on each event card
- Example: #Python #Music #Football
- Tags are visual indicators (filtering optional)

────────────────────────
3) EVENT CARD DESIGN (PROFESSIONAL)
────────────────────────
Each event card must display:
- Event image/poster
- Event title
- Category label (color-coded)
- Tags
- Date & time
- Location
- Short description (preview)
- Action button:
  - “Register” or “Apply” if registration is required
  - “View Details” if not

Use modern card layout with hover effects and Framer Motion animations.

────────────────────────
4) EVENT DETAILS PAGE (NO COMMENTS)
────────────────────────
Enhance event details page with:
- Full event description
- Banner image
- Category & tags
- Date, time, and location
- Countdown timer (“Starts in X days”)
- Registration status
- Participant count
- Cancelled badge (if cancelled)
- “Add to Calendar” button
- “Save Event” button

DO NOT include comments or discussions.

────────────────────────
5) REGISTRATION LOGIC
────────────────────────
If requires_registration = true:
- Allow students to register
- Prevent registration when max_participants is reached
- Update current_participants in real time
- Show success confirmation after registration
- Disable registration if event is cancelled

────────────────────────
6) SAVE / FAVORITE EVENTS
────────────────────────
- Allow students to save/favorite events
- Create a “Saved Events” section in profile/dashboard
- Persist saved events in database

────────────────────────
7) CALENDAR INTEGRATION
────────────────────────
Provide “Add to Calendar” support:
- Google Calendar
- Apple Calendar
- ICS file export

Include event title, date, time, and location.

────────────────────────
8) NOTIFICATIONS (INTEGRATE WITH EXISTING SYSTEM)
────────────────────────
Send notifications for:
- New event created
- Successful registration
- Event updates
- Event cancellation
- Reminders:
  - 24 hours before
  - 1 hour before
  - 10 minutes before (optional)

Use existing Socket.IO + notification infrastructure.

────────────────────────
9) PERSONALIZED EVENT RECOMMENDATIONS
────────────────────────
Recommend events based on:
- User department
- User interests (tags)
- Previously registered or saved events

Display recommendations on:
- Dashboard
- Events page (Recommended for You section)

────────────────────────
10) UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────
- Keep existing design language
- Clean, minimal, professional
- Card-based layout
- Dark / Light mode
- Fully responsive
- Skeleton loaders for events
- Smooth animations (Framer Motion)

────────────────────────
11) SEED DATA
────────────────────────
Add demo events:
- Different categories
- With & without registration
- Online & physical events
- Events with max participants
- Saved & registered demo users

────────────────────────
