You are a senior full-stack engineer. 

The Digital College Platform project exists with React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Framer Motion frontend, Node.js + Express backend, MongoDB, JWT authentication, and basic Campus Groups scaffolding.

Task: Fully implement the Campus Groups feature with ALL core and useful extra features, except “view-only for non-members”. Integrate it into the existing project.

Requirements:

1) DATABASE MODELS
- Group: name, description, department, category, createdBy, members, createdAt
- GroupPost: group, author, content, createdAt

2) BACKEND ROUTES
- Groups:
  - POST /api/groups → create (admin only)
  - GET /api/groups → list all
  - GET /api/groups/:id → details
  - POST /api/groups/:id/join → join group (prevent duplicates)
  - POST /api/groups/:id/leave → leave group
- Group Posts:
  - POST /api/groups/:id/posts → create post (members only)
  - GET /api/groups/:id/posts → list posts
  - Admin/group creator can delete posts
- Protect routes with JWT
- Validate input, sanitize content, proper JSON responses

3) FRONTEND
- Groups List Page:
  - Grid of cards: name, department, category, members count
  - Join / Leave buttons
  - Search/filter by department/category
- Group Details Page:
  - Show group info and members
  - Join / Leave buttons
  - Posts feed
  - Input to create posts (members only)
- Components: GroupCard, PostCard
- Loading skeletons, toast notifications
- Fully responsive, dark/light mode, smooth animations

4) POST INTERACTIONS & EXTRA
- Members can post text (optionally images/files)
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO
- Pagination or infinite scroll for posts
- Activity stats (posts count, member activity)
- Search posts inside a group

5) STATE MANAGEMENT
- Sync join/leave and posts with backend
- Update UI instantly

6) SEED DATA
- Demo groups: Programming Club, AI & ML, Robotics Team, Network Security
- Include demo members and posts

Output:
- Fully functional Campus Groups module
- Clean, maintainable, professional code
- Integrated with existing project
- Keep rest of project unchanged
- No placeholders or dummy logic
